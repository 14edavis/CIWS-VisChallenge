## Sample Graphs

Basilisk makes use of datetime timestamps to visualize residential water usage through various averaging and filtering functions. 
For example, it can graph average water usage throughout the day.

Using the same method, it can also compare water use on the weekend to weekdays.

Want more detail? Graph average water usage for each individual day of the week.

You can view the typical week as a whole by averaging the water usage by weekday.

Or get creative, and tack together your hourly-average data into a more detailed graph.

Speaking of creative, what happens if you average water usage by the minute-stamp? 
(i.e. all the water pulses at 1:43, 2:43, 3:43, 4:43, etc. belong to the same group) 
Turns out that this unusual analysis show a pattern, too. Now we can see that Monday/Wednesday/Friday all have a similar schedule. 
So do Tuesday/Thursday.

What if you don't want averages, but a simple timeline instead? Just pick a timeframe and the appropriate filter & resolution.

Watch daily water usage over a month.

Compare the hourly use to the minute-by-minute use for a particular day.

Or show the maximum resolution, water pulse counts every 4 seconds, for a given morning.

These examples just scratch the surface.
Whether you use Basilisk as-is or as a template for more complicated projects, 
Basilisk provides the scaffolding you need to visualize residential water usage.
